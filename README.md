## Setting up the project
This is a ClojureScript project. To create a development environment from scratch you will need to install:

* A Java virtual machine. (e.g. A [recent JRE from Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html))
* Clojure. Follow [these installation instructions](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started), which will provide the CLI tools, namely the `clojure` and `clj` commands.
* Babashka. This will allow you to run the tasks found in `bb.edn` to create the builds. See [the github repo](https://github.com/babashka/babashka) for the installation instructions.
* Sass. This will allow you to compile .scss files in to the css stylesheets. Follow [these instructions](https://sass-lang.com/install) to install it.
* A suitable text editor. Emacs, IntelliJ community edition (cursive plugin), Atom (Proto-REPL plugin) are all sensible options. See [this discussion](https://practical.li/clojure/clojure-editors/) on the most common editors used in the community.
>
Once you have all these tools and their required dependencies installed, you can start generating the project's files that will be served.

## CSS generation

If you are using Linux, the following task will generate the styles in `target/public/css`.

```shell
$ bb sass
```

On Windows, you should type the following from the root directory:

```shell
$ mkdir .\target\public\css
$ sass .\sass\app.scss .\target\public\css\app.css
```

## HTML generation

Pages are generated for the correct build, as the html files must reference the correct js file. Figwheel-main creates a js file named by the build (e.g. `dev-main.js` for the dev build) in `target/public/cljs-out/`.

On Linux:

```shell
$ bb gen-html 
```
> This will generate the html pages for a production build.


```shell
$ bb gen-html-dev 
```
> This will generate the html pages for a development build.

On Windows:

```shell
$ clj -X:gen 
```
> This will generate the html pages for a production build.


```shell
$ clj -X:gen-dev 
```
> This will generate the html pages for a development build.


## Development build

To create a development build with hot-reload and connect a cljs REPL using figwheel-main, execute in a Linux terminal:

```shell
$ bb gen-dev
```

On Windows, type:

```shell
$ clojure -M:fig:build-dev
```

Executing these lines will download and install all the necessary dependencies.

### Using Emacs

To launch a development environment within Emacs using CIDER, open one of your source file (e.g. main.cljs) with clojurescript-mode. Then with the cursor on this file, type `M-x cider-jack-in-cljs`.
This uses the .dir-locals.el file, selecting `figwheel-main` as your REPL, `clojure-cli` as your build tool, the `dev` build and appending `-A:fig` when launching the nREPL.

See [CIDER's documentation](https://docs.cider.mx/cider/basics/clojurescript#_clojure_cli_figwheel_main_setup) for more information.

### Using VSCode/Calva

To launch a development environment within Emacs using Calva, go to the root project and launch the jack-in process by pressing `ctrl+alt+c ctrl+alt+j`.
Then select the project type `deps.edn + Figwheel Main`, tick the `:calva` alias to launch with and click `OK`.
This will first launch a clojure REPL. Calva will then prompt you for the build to start. Select `dev` and click `OK`.
Now the clojurescript REPL will launch, a browser tab will open to http://localhost:9500, and the REPL prompt will appear once the connexion of the REPL to the build is made.

See [this article](https://practical.li/blog/posts/clojure-repl-jack-in-or-connect/) for more information on the different jack-in processes and how to automate them.

## Production build

To create a production build on Linux, type:

```shell
$ bb gen 
```

On Windows, use:

```shell
$ clj -M:build-min 
```

# Updated development builds
## Development builds


> We've switched the main development build to use IntelliJ (community edition with the Cursive plugin) plus Figwheel.
> To run SASS as part of the build follow the Fighwel instructions for working with cursive, but make a
> run configuration that uses script/figwheel.clj rather than script/repl.clj.

> Instructions below are for a SASS-less emacs build. You can switch to this by changing the project.clj
> figwheel dependencies back to the default figwheel setup so figwheel-sidecar is no longer used. If you do this
> you'll also need to add in SASS. Probably easiest to add it to gulp.

There are two development builds - one for [devcards](https://github.com/bhauman/devcards) and one for the PRAIS2 site. The devcards build is good for testing and visualising code and site components. You can switch between these two options at run time.


This is a ClojureScript project. To create a development environment from scratch you will need to install:

* A Java virtual machine. (e.g. A [recent JRE from Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html))
* Leiningen. Follow [these installation instructions](http://leiningen.org/), which will provide the `lein` command.
* A suitable text editor. I originally used emacs with an [emacs-live set up](http://overtone.github.io/emacs-live/) for clojurescript development, but later switched to IntelliJ community edition with the Cursive plugin. Another good alternative is the Atom editor with the Proto-REPL plugin.
>
Once you have leiningen installed, get an interactive development environment for running by typing:
```
git clone https://github.com/gmp26/prais2cljs.git prais2
cd prais2
lein figwheel
```
in a terminal or command line window. This will download and install all other dependencies and launch a local development server. 

### Setting up IntelliJ

Create run configuration with options below.

* Change to Clojure Main REPL.
* In Common Option - Parameters add "script/figwheel.clj"

### Switching builds

In a REPL, say `(switch-to-build :devcards)` or `(switch-to-build :dev)`.

### To work with devcards

Open your browser at http://localhost:3449/cards.html to view. Once a browser connects you will have a REPL executing there allowing you to test cljs functions in situ. Use clojure's `in-ns` function to switch namespace to the source file you are working on. Source maps are provided so you are able to step through clojurescript code in Chrome Developer Tools.

### To work with the site
Open your browser at http://localhost:3449/index.html to view.

In both development builds, 
[Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) gives you live reloading into the browser. 


Production build
----------------

To clean all compiled files:

    lein clean

To create a production build run:

    lein cljsbuild once min

-->

## Test

Test by serving out the target/public folder (e.g. with python 2, `cd target/public & python -m 'SimpleHTTPServer'` and then viewing localhost:8000. In python 3, `cd target/public & python -m 'http.server'`).

## Deployment

Upload and serve the target/public folder.
> Be sure to have generated the styles and relevant html pages and build first.

## Other dependencies

The project uses ReactJS to provide a fast virtual DOM, together with the Reagent flavour
of [tonsky/rum](https://github.com/tonsky/rum) to drive React. To create an initial fresh, empty figwheel/Rum/ReactJS project I used [this Leiningen template](https://github.com/gmp26/fwrum). See project.clj for details.

If upgrading dependencies, pay attention to the latest versions of React that Rum supports.
