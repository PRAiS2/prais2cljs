# Prais2

Communicating the risks of infant surgery.

## Development builds


> We've switched the main development build to use IntelliJ (community edition with the Cursive plugin) plus Figwheel.
> To run SASS as part of the build follow the Fighwel instructions for working with cursive, but make a
> run configuration that uses script/figwheel.clj rather than script/repl.clj.

> Instructions below are for a SASS-less emacs build. You can switch to this by changing the project.clj
> figwheel dependencies back to the default figwheel setup so figwheel-sidecar is no longer used. If you do this
> you'll also need to add in SASS. Probably easiest to add it to gulp.

There are two development builds - one for [devcards](https://github.com/bhauman/devcards) and one for the PRAIS2 site. The devcards build is good for testing and visualising code and site components. You can switch between these two options at run time.


This is a ClojureScript project. To create a development environment from scratch you will need to install:

* A Java virtual machine. (e.g. A [recent JRE from Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html))
* Leiningen. Follow [these installation instructions](http://leiningen.org/), which will provide the `lein` command.
* A suitable text editor. I use emacs with an [emacs-live set up](http://overtone.github.io/emacs-live/) for clojurescript development. You may prefer Sublime or LightTable or IntelliJ with the Cursive plugin for Clojure. 
>
Once you have leiningen installed, get an interactive development environment for running by typing:
```
git clone https://github.com/gmp26/prais2cljs.git prais2
cd prais2
lein figwheel
```
in a terminal or command line window. This will download and install all other dependencies and launch a local development server. 

### Switching builds

In a REPL, say `(switch-to-build :devcards)` or `(switch-to-build :dev)`.

### To work with devcards

Open your browser at http://localhost:3449/cards.html to view. Once a browser connects you will have a REPL executing there allowing you to test cljs functions in situ. Use clojure's `in-ns` function to switch namespace to the source file you are working on. Source maps are provided so you are able to step through clojurescript code in Chrome Developer Tools.

### To work with the site
Open your browser at http://localhost:3449/index.html to view.

In both development builds, 
[Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) gives you live reloading into the browser. 


Production build
----------------

To clean all compiled files:

    lein clean

To create a production build run:

    lein cljsbuild once min

Test 
----
Test by serving out the resources/public folder (e.g. with `cd resources/public & python -m'SimpleHTTPServer'` and then viewing localhost:8000).

Deployment
----------

Upload and serve the resources/public folder. 

You'll probably want to limit the client-side app to just the interactive parts of the current app for SEO purposes.

## Other dependencies

The project uses ReactJS to provide a fast virtual DOM, together with the Reagent flavour
of [tonsky/rum](https://github.com/tonsky/rum) to drive React. To create an initial fresh, empty figwheel/Rum/ReactJS project I used [this Leiningen template](https://github.com/gmp26/fwrum). See project.clj for details.
