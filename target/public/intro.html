   rate. The 30-day survival rate is the percentage of operations where the child survived to at least 30 days after
   their heart surgery. Ireland also submits its data to the same audit body, <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/nicor/audits/congenital" target="_blank">NCHDA</a>.</p><p class="col-sm-12">Approximately 3500 children under the age of 16 have heart surgery each year in the United Kingdom
   and Republic of Ireland.</p></section></section><section id="2" class="col-sm-8 pull-left"><h2><strong>Why</strong> can data about survival be difficult to interpret?</h2><section class="row"><p class="col-lg-12">Heart disease covers a wide range of disorders, from relatively minor to more severe conditions. Some hospitals
    take on more complicated conditions and tend to operate on children with a lower chance of survival. Also, every
    child is unique and may respond differently to treatment (surgery, drugs, postoperative care).</p><p class="col-lg-12">We therefore would not expect all hospitals to have the same survival rate: we should take into account how ill
    the children were that the hospitals treated. In other words, if one hospital has a higher survival rate than
    another hospital this is not necessarily evidence that one hospital is better than the other – it could
    indicate that the second hospital treated children with more severe problems. </p></section></section><section id="3" class="col-sm-8 pull-left"><h2><strong>How</strong> does the NHS monitor hospitals that do children’s heart surgery?</h2><section class="row"><div class="col-lg-12"><p>When reviewing the 30-day survival rate for each hospital, the NHS takes into account how ill the children were
    that each hospital treated. This is a fairer way of looking at survival rate data.</p><p>Risk factors that affect a child’s chance of survival include:</p><ul><li>the age and weight of the child (other things being equal, the bigger and stronger a child is, the safer the
      surgery is); </li><li>what problem in the heart the surgery is trying to fix (some hearts have more complex problems than others); </li><li>other health problems a child might have (e.g. a genetic syndrome); </li><li>the complexity of the surgical procedure.  </li></ul><p>Knowing these factors for each child allows us to predict the percentage of children within a group that will
    survive, even though we cannot predict exactly whether individual children will survive.</p><p>The national audit body (<a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/nicor/audits/congenital" target="_blank">NCHDA</a>)
    uses a statistical formula to combine data on these risk factors for all the children a hospital has treated over
    the previous three years to give a predicted range for the overall proportion of survivors for that specific
    hospital and time period. The formula is also used to calculate an extended predicted range for survival for each
    hospital. The audit body then compares the survival rate achieved by a hospital with its predicted and extended
    predicted range. Our <a href="/data/animation"><i class="fa fa-video-camera"></i> two minute video</a> explains how
    we present these comparisons in this site.</p><p>If you&#x27;d like to know how the predicted range is actually calculated, you can watch our
    <a href="/faqs"><i class="fa fa-video-camera"></i> second short video</a> in the <a href="/faqs">Everything Else</a> section.</p><p>If a hospital’s survival rate is within its predicted range, its results are in line with what we expect.
    For more information about how the NHS monitors survival rates see the  <a href="/faqs">Everything Else</a> section.</p><div class="bg-danger"><p>IMPORTANT! The predicted range depends on the types of patients treated at that hospital over that time
      period – so each hospital will have a different predicted range and its predicted range will vary from year to
      year.</p><p>That is why we only compare a hospital’s survival rate to its predicted range (from the statistical formula)
      and <strong>not</strong> to survival rates at other hospitals.</p></div></div></section></section><section id="4" class="col-sm-8 pull-left"><h2>What this site cannot do</h2><section class="row"><div class="col-lg-12"><p><b>This site cannot help parents make decisions about their child’s treatment.</b> If you are concerned about your child’s treatment plan <b>please speak with your child’s cardiologist or surgeon</b>.
