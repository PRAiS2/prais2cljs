       from communication experts at Sense about Science and the academic psychologists at King’s College London. Over
       the next 10 months, Sense about Science held four sets of two workshops, to test the web content. At each stage,
       one workshop was with interested potential users (e.g. press officers; health journalists; policy professionals)
       and the other workshop was with parents of children who had heart surgery. At each stage, we invited different
       individuals to attend each workshop in order to test the updated content with people who had not seen the previous
       versions. We also asked participants from past workshops to provide feedback on the animations and website as they developed. </p><p>As the website took shape in the autumn of 2015, the academic psychologists at King’s College London did
       formal tests of specific sentences and concepts discussed in the website to see if one way of explaining the
       concepts worked better than another and to pinpoint where there was possibility for confusion. We also shared
       the evolving website with the clinical community including surgeons, intensive care doctors, the national audit
       body, data experts and cardiologists, to incorporate their feedback too. </p><p>Over time, the website took shape, evolving a great deal over the year in response to the workshops, the
       psychology experiments and other feedback. We user tested everything from layout to colours to language to page
       navigation and very little remains from the original draft content. </p><p>Sense about Science have also produced a <a href="http://senseaboutscience.org/activities/public-engagement-guide/" target="_blank">free practical guide</a> for researchers on how to engage the public
                                based on the model we used for this website.</p><p>Looking back, we cannot thank all those who gave feedback enough – this website is immeasurably better with
       their input than it would otherwise have been. Any niggles that remain are our responsibility alone.  </p><p>We would also like to thank our funder, the UK National Institute of Health Research, for encouraging us to
       think ambitiously about how to develop this site and giving us the time and money to do it. </p><h4>Explanatory videos</h4><p>Very many thanks to <a href="http://www.therichardstonepartnership.co.uk/artist-details/leighton_pugh" target="_blank">Leighton Pugh</a> for donating his time and expertise to narrating both
                          videos. The artwork and production for both videos was with developed in collaboration with
                          <a href="http://www.qudos-animations.co.uk/" target="_blank">Qudos Animations</a>. We thank them
                          for their great work and responsiveness in working to tight deadlines.</p></div></div><nav><ul class="pager"><li><a href="/faq/4/1"><i class="fa fa-arrow-left"></i> previous</a></li><li><a href="/faq/4/3">next <i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div></div><div class="container-fluid partners"><div class="row visible-xs-block"><div class="col-xs-offset-1"><h4><a href="/faq/4/0" class="link"><span>Project partners <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></span></a></h4><ul style="list-style-type:none;"><li>University College, London</li><li>University of Cambridge</li><li>King&#x27;s College, London</li><li>Sense about Science</li><li>Children&#x27;s Heart Federation</li></ul></div></div><div class="row hidden-xs"><div class="col-sm-10 collab-logo"><a href="/faq/4/0" class="link">About us</a>| <a href="/faq/4/1">Contact us</a></div><div class="col-sm-10 collab-logo col-md-offset-1 col-md-11"><img src="/assets/ucl-logo.png" style="width:190px;"/><img src="/assets/camlogo.png" style="width:220px;"/><img src="/assets/KCLlogo.gif" style="width:130px;"/><img src="/assets/sas-logo.png" style="width:80px;"/><img src="/assets/chf-logo.png" style="width:80px;"/></div></div><div class="row footer"><div class="acks col-md-offset-1"><h3>Funding acknowledgement</h3><p>This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Services and Delivery Research
