00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.400
To understand how a hospital is doing,

2
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.400
we calculate the hospital’s survival rate

3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.800
And compare this to its 
predicted range of survival

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.500
If the hospital is doing as predicted, 
then we expect the survival rate

5
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.800
to be within the predicted range 
nearly all of the time

6
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.200
But how is the predicted range 
of survival calculated?

7
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.500
We look at the children 
the hospital has treated

8
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.600
To make the numbers easy, let’s suppose that 
the hospital has done exactly 100 heart operations

9
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.500
The NHS collects data on all children who 
have surgery, which includes things like

10
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.250
age

11
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.900
weight

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.900
diagnosis

13
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.400
Difficulty of the proposed surgery

14
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.900
and complicating conditions.

15
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.100
All of these factors can affect 
a child’s chances of survival.

16
00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.100
A statistical formula weighs up these factors 
for each child and calculates a chance of survival.

17
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.600
We do this for all the children 
that the hospital treated

18
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.500
We cannot predict exactly what will happen 
to these children, and sadly it is very unlikely

19
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.200
that they will all survive.

20
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.100
A plausible way for things to turn out 
is that 2 don’t survive.

21
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.100
giving an overall 98% survival rate

22
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:39.100
Given all the chances that have been calculated, 
another plausible result is

23
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.600
that 3 out of these 100 children 
don’t survive.

24
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.000
Giving a 97% overall survival rate.

25
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.100
We can consider lots of other plausible 
outcomes for these 100 children.

26
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.600
We calculate the width of the predicted range 
so that that the overall survival rate

27
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.100
for the hospital lies within it 19 times 
out of 20, given the chances calculated

28
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.100
for these children using the formula. 
Let’s watch this in action.

29
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:29.100
We can keep on considering possible 
outcomes for these 100 children.

30
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.000
We calculate the width of this wider interval, 
the extended predicted range,

31
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.700
so that the overall survival rate for the hospital 
lies within it 998 times out of a 1000.

32
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.100
Again, let’s watch this in action.

33
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.500
We now have the predicted and 
extended predicted ranges

34
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.100
for the children treated at this hospital.

35
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.700
When a hospital does relatively few operations, 
unforeseeable factors have a bigger influence

36
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.200
on the overall survival rate,
and so it has a wider predicted range

37
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.200
than a hospital that does more operations.

38
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.800
The predicted range depends only 
on the children treated by a hospital.

39
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.000
Different hospitals will always have different 
predicted ranges since they treat different children.

40
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.500
So, if one hospital has a lower predicted range 
than another, it is only because

41
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.500
it treated children with 
more complex medical problems.

42
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.100

along with other information,
