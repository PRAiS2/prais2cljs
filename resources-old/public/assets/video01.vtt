00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.400
How do we report
what happened at a hospital?


00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.100
Over a 3 year period, we calculate
the proportion of children treated at the hospital 


00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.100
who survived to at least 30 days after
their surgery: the survival rate. 


00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.250
As some hospitals will treat children with
more complex medical problems than other hospitals


00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.400
we would not expect all hospitals
to have the same survival rate.


00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.200
So it doesn't make sense to simply compare
one hospital's survival rate to another's.


00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.250
Instead, we use the statistical formula 
to calculate the predicted range of survival  


00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.000
for the children that hospital has treated, 
which depends only on the complexity 


00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.050
of the medical problems of those children.


00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.250
We then compare a hospital's survival rate
to its predicted range.


00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.150
How do we interpret this?


00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.300
If the survival rate lies in the dark blue area 
(the predicted range), then there is no evidence 


00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.400
that the chances of survival of children at that 
hospital were different from what was predicted.


00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.300
If the survival rate turns out to lie in the 
light blue area, this means there is some evidence 


00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.350
that the chances of survival at that hospital 
were different from that predicted by the formula.


00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.200
If the survival rate lies outside either blue area, 
this means that there is strong evidence  


00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.200
that the chances of survival at that hospital 
were different from that predicted by the formula.


00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.250
If there is some, or strong, evidence 
that chances of survival at a hospital 


00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.250
were lower than predicted, then the audit body, 
the relevant national health service 


00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.300
and the hospital all work together to check 
the data and take any appropriate actions.
