     rate outside their predicted range?</div></h2><section class="short-answer"><div class="icon"><i class="fa fa-comment"></i></div><div class="reply">When looking at all 13 hospitals at once, we expect at least one hospital’s survival rate to be
      outside its predicted range about half the time.</div></section><div class="body"><div><p>If we were looking at only one hospital, we’d expect its survival rate to fall outside its predicted range
       rarely if chances of survival at the hospitals match the formula: just 1 time in 20. BUT, if we are looking at
       all 14 hospitals at once, we’d actually expect that at least one hospital will fall outside its range just by
       chance about 8 times in 20!</p><p>This is similar to the situation where you hear a friend won a good prize in a raffle. This may be
       surprising, but it becomes a lot less surprising when you hear they bought 100 tickets. Just as this gave them
       more chances of winning, the more hospitals we look at, the more likely it becomes that at least one will fall
       outside its range, even if survival at all the hospitals matches the formula.</p><p>So, on average, we’d anticipate about half of NICOR’s annual reports to have at least one hospital outside
       its range, either above or below, by chance alone.</p><p>Considering now the <i>extended predicted range</i>, if we look at all 13 hospitals at once, we’d only
       expect <i>any</i> one of them to be outside their extended range very rarely, just 1 time in 40. This is why
       a hospital’s survival rate being outside the extended predicted range is considered strong evidence that the
       chances of a patient surviving at that hospital are different to what is expected.</p><p>NOTE: As of 2016, Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast no longer operates on children with congenital heart
       disease, so there are now 13 hospitals in the UK and Ireland that perform these operations.</p></div></div><div><hr/><dl><dt><i>Survival rate</i></dt><dd>The percentage of operations where the child survived at least 30 days after their operation.</dd></dl></div><button class="btn btn-primary back">Back</button></div></div></div></div><div class="container-fluid partners"><div class="row"><p style="color:white;" class="col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-2">About us</p><img src="/assets/ucl-logo.png" class="img-responsive col-sm-2 collab-logo"/><img src="/assets/camlogo.png" class="img-responsive col-sm-2 collab-logo"/><img src="/assets/KCLlogo.gif" class="img-responsive col-sm-1 collab-logo"/><img src="/assets/sas-logo.png" class="img-responsive col-sm-1 collab-logo"/><img src="/assets/chf-logo.png" class="img-responsive col-sm-1 collab-logo"/></div><div class="row footer"><h3>Funding acknowledgement</h3><p>This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Services and Delivery Research Programme
