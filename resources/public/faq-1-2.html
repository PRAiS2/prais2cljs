      that for some reason doesn’t work well for that hospital, just by chance (1 time in 20), or the chances of
      survival at that hospital are different to what is predicted. </div></section><div class="body"><div><p>Possible reasons for a hospital’s survival rate being outside its predicted range of survival:</p><h4>1. Inaccurate data</h4><p>Each hospital and the Office of National Statistics supply data on each child to the national audit body.
       Although the <a href="/faq/2/1.html">data submitted is of very high quality</a>, there will always be some
       inaccuracies is such large datasets. If a hospital submits data where some of the data is very wrong (for
       instance wrong weights are recorded) or missing, then this will result in a wrong predicted range.</p><h4>2. The formula doesn’t work well for that hospital</h4><p>The statistical formula is applied to all operations at that hospital to calculate its overall predicted
       range of survival. Although <a href="/faq/2/0.html">the formula as is as good as we can currently get it</a>, it is not perfect.
       There will always be unique features about a child that affect their
       chance of survival that are not captured by national data collection and so cannot be part of a formula (e.g. the
       size of a hole in the heart). We will never be able to capture the whole medical picture of a child in a single
       formula! That means that the predicted range is the best possible guess for what the predicted range should be.
       If a hospital happens to have operated on a lot of children with unique features that affect their chances of
       survival but are not captured by the formula, the predicted range might be unfairly high for that hospital.</p><h4>3. Chance</h4><p>If the hospital’s data contains no errors and there’s no reason to think that the formula shouldn’t apply
       well to that hospital, then in 19 times out of 20, we’d expect to see a hospital’s overall survival range within
       the predicted range. The means that the hospital’s survival rate could be outside its predicted range just by
       chance (1 time in 20).</p><h4>4. The chances of survival at that hospital are different to what are predicted by the formula.</h4><p>The chances of survival for children at the hospital could genuinely be much higher or lower than what is
       predicted, which would make it more likely that the hospital’s survival rate would lie outside its predicted
       range. The national audit process is intended to check that no hospital in the UK and Ireland has chances of
       survival much lower than predicted. See <a href="/faq/1/4.html">What happens if a hospital’s survival is below its predicted range</a> to
       find out what happens in such situations.</p></div></div><div><hr/><dl><dt><i>Survival rate</i></dt><dd>The percentage of operations where the child survived at least 30 days after their operation.</dd></dl></div><button class="btn btn-primary back">Back</button></div></div></div></div><div class="container-fluid partners"><div style="width:300px;color:white;" class="row visible-xs-block center-block"><h4><a href="/faq/4/0.html">Project partners:</a></h4><p>University College, London</p><p>University of Cambridge</p><p>King&#x27;s College, London</p><p>Sense about Science</p><p>Children&#x27;s Heart Federation</p></div><div class="row hidden-xs"><div class="col-sm-12 collab-logo col-md-offset-1"><a href="/faq/4/0.html">About us</a></div><div class="col-sm-12 collab-logo col-md-offset-1"><img src="/assets/ucl-logo.png" style="width:190px;"/><img src="/assets/camlogo.png" style="width:220px;"/><img src="/assets/KCLlogo.gif" style="width:130px;"/><img src="/assets/sas-logo.png" style="width:80px;"/><img src="/assets/chf-logo.png" style="width:80px;"/></div></div><div class="row footer"><div class="acks col-md-offset-1"><h3>Funding acknowledgement</h3><p>This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Services and Delivery Research Programme
