       from communication experts at Sense about Science and the academic psychologists at King’s College London. Over
       the next 10 months, Sense about Science held four sets of two workshops each, to test the web content. At each stage,
       one workshop was with interested potential users (e.g. press officers; health journalists; policy people) and the
       other workshop was with parents of children who had heart surgery. We asked new people to come to
       the workshops at each stage so we could get fresh impressions. </p><p>As the website took shape in the autumn of 2015, the academic psychologists at King’s College London did
       formal tests of specific sentences and concepts discussed in the website to see if one way of explaining the
       concepts worked better than another and to pinpoint where there was possibility for confusion. We also shared
       the evolving website with the clinical community including surgeons, intensive care doctors, data experts and
       cardiologists, to incorporate their feedback too. </p><p>Over time, the website took shape, changing massively over the year in response to the workshops, the
       psychology experiments and other feedback. We asked about everything from layout to colours to language to page
       navigation and very little remains from the original draft content! </p><p>Looking back, we cannot thank all those who gave feedback enough – this website is immeasurably better with
       their input than it would otherwise have been. Any niggles that remain are our responsibility alone.  </p><p>We would also like to thank our funder, the UK National Institute of Health Research, for encouraging us to
       think ambitiously about how to develop this site and giving us the time and money to do it! </p></div></div><button class="btn btn-primary back">Back</button></div></div></div></div><div class="container-fluid partners"><div class="row"><p style="color:white;" class="col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-2">About us</p><img src="/assets/ucl-logo.png" class="img-responsive col-sm-2 collab-logo"/><img src="/assets/camlogo.png" class="img-responsive col-sm-2 collab-logo"/><img src="/assets/KCLlogo.gif" class="img-responsive col-sm-1 collab-logo"/><img src="/assets/sas-logo.png" class="img-responsive col-sm-1 collab-logo"/><img src="/assets/chf-logo.png" class="img-responsive col-sm-1 collab-logo"/></div><div class="row footer"><h3>Funding acknowledgement</h3><p>This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Services and Delivery Research Programme
