                            maths to problems in the NHS. She works very closely with doctors and other clinical staff, mainly at Great
                            Ormond Street Hospital, to help them use routinely collected data to improve NHS services. Her work currently
                            focuses on two areas: 1) care for children requiring heart surgery and 2) how specialist intensive care is
                            organised for children who need it (for whatever reason). </p><p>Christina helped developed a statistical method called PRAiS to let hospitals and the national audit body
        easily monitor survival outcomes after heart surgery in children. In this project, Christina worked with Sense
        about Science, the University of Cambridge, King’s College London and the Children’s Heart Federation to develop
        these online resources to help people interpret the audit body’s published results. In particular, she wrote a
        lot of the content, helped enormously by feedback from the team and the user workshops. Thanks to <strong>Dr Andrew Wilshere</strong> for designing our logo! </p></div><div class="image-para"><p><img src="assets/camlogo-old.png" class="pull-left w150"/><strong>Professor David Spiegelhalter</strong> is a statistician from Cambridge University.   He has worked for many years with doctors from Great Ormond
                            Street Hospital on monitoring outcomes following surgery for congenital heart disease, and led the statistical
                            team at the Bristol Royal Infirmary Inquiry.  He is particularly interested in transparent communication, and
                            was part of the team that drew up the new national patient information leaflets for breast cancer screening.
                            For this project, David helped write the content, especially the language around the statistical formula and
                            predicted range.  <strong>Mike Pearson</strong> developed the website and data visualisations,
                            working closely with the animation team, <a href="https://qudos.com" target="_blank">Qudos</a>.</p></div><div class="image-para"><p><img src="assets/KCLlogo.gif" class="pull-left w100"/><strong>Dr Tim Rakow</strong> is a Reader in Psychology
                            who studies how people make choices and how best to provide information to help people make decisions.
                            He has previously worked with the cardiologists and heart surgeons at Great Ormond Street looking at
                            their decisions about surgery, and with Professor Spiegelhalter on the public’s understanding of
                            complex statistical information. For this project, he worked with Emily Blackshaw, another psychologist
                            at King’s College London, to run experiments that examined which types of explanation and graphics
                            would be the best ones for us to include in this website.</p></div><div class="image-para"><p><img src="assets/sas-logo.png" class="pull-left w100"/><strong>Sense About Science</strong> is a UK-based charity that works to put science and evidence in the hands of
         the public. They are a source of information, challenge misinformation, and champion sound science and evidence
         with the help of scientists, academics, and experts in various fields. For this project, they facilitated the
         workshops with parents, other interested users and members of the public who helped to co-develop the website
         over four sets of two workshops and stopped the academics going into too much mathematical detail! </p></div><div class="image-para"><p><img src="assets/chf-logo.png" class="pull-left w100"/><strong>The Children’s Heart Federation</strong> is the main umbrella body for British CHD charities and
         voluntary organisations. They publicised this project among their members and coordinated the involvement of
         parents of children who had heart surgery in our workshops.</p></div><p>If you have any comments about the website please email: (MIKE: Generic email)</p></div></div><button class="btn btn-primary back">Back</button></div></div></div></div><div class="container-fluid partners"><div class="row"><p style="color:white;" class="col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-2">About us</p><img src="assets/ucl-logo.png" class="img-responsive col-sm-2 collab-logo"/><img src="assets/camlogo.png" class="img-responsive col-sm-2 collab-logo"/><img src="assets/KCLlogo.gif" class="img-responsive col-sm-1 collab-logo"/><img src="assets/sas-logo.png" class="img-responsive col-sm-1 collab-logo"/><img src="assets/chf-logo.png" class="img-responsive col-sm-1 collab-logo"/></div><div class="row footer"><h3>Funding acknowledgement</h3><p>This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Services and Delivery Research Programme
