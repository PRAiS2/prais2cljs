                            maths to problems in the NHS. She works very closely with doctors and other clinical staff, mainly at Great
                            Ormond Street Hospital, to help them use routinely collected data to improve NHS services. Her work currently
                            focuses on two areas: 1) care for children requiring heart surgery and 2) how specialist intensive care is
                            organised for children who need it (for whatever reason). </p><p>Christina helped developed a statistical method called PRAiS to let hospitals and the national audit body
        easily monitor survival outcomes after heart surgery in children. In this project, Christina worked with Sense
        about Science, the University of Cambridge, King’s College London and the Children’s Heart Federation to develop
        these online resources to help people interpret the audit body’s published results. In particular, she wrote a
        lot of the content, helped enormously by feedback from the team and the user workshops.

He has worked for many years with doctors from Great Ormond
                            Street Hospital on monitoring outcomes following surgery for congenital heart disease, and led the statistical
                            team at the Bristol Royal Infirmary Inquiry.  He is particularly interested in transparent communication, and
                            was part of the team that drew up the new national patient information leaflets for breast cancer screening.
                            For this project, David helped write the content, especially the language around the statistical formula and
                            predicted range.  <a href="http://understandinguncertainty.org">Mike Pearson</a> developed the website and data visualisations,

                            their decisions about surgery, and with Professor Spiegelhalter on the public’s understanding of

                            at King’s College London, to run experiments that examined which types of explanation and graphics
