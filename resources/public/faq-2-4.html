      since different types of hospital have different treatment pathways for very sick patients (for instance some will
      transfer patients to another hospital or some to local palliative care). </div></section><div class="body"><div><p>Two very common measures used for looking at a hospital’s outcomes are “survival at discharge from hospital”
       and “30 day survival” after an operation. Survival at discharge is often used in other contexts as it’s the
       easiest to obtain – it is included within standard hospital records. However, survival to discharge does depend
       on the discharge procedures at that hospital. For instance, some hospitals will transfer very sick patients to
       other, more specialised hospitals, meaning that more patients will be alive at discharge from that hospital than
       the specialised hospital. Some hospitals might have close links with local palliative care services and so might
       discharge patients to these services if further treatment is considered unavailing. Again, such hospitals with
       have more patients alive at discharge compared to a hospital that look after the sickest patients until they die. </p><p>Therefore, if it is available, “30 day survival” after surgery is considered a more objective and preferable
       statistic than “survival to hospital discharge”, since it does not depend on the hospital’s discharge procedures.</p><p>While <a href="#/faq/2/3">longer term survival</a> is extremely important, 30-day survival post
       surgery was initially chosen as it is more straightforward to link this outcome to a child’s surgery and
       post-operative care than a longer range survival  period which might, for instance, incorporate further treatment
       at different hospitals. The other important aspect of monitoring 30-day survival, particularly within hospitals,
       is that any worrying outcomes can be investigated very quickly since the survival outcomes are available
       (locally) within 30 days of a child’s operation.</p></div></div><button class="btn btn-primary back">Back</button></div></div></div></div><div class="container-fluid partners"><div class="row"><img src="assets/ucl-logo.png" class="img-responsive col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-2 collab-logo"/><img src="assets/camlogo.png" class="img-responsive col-sm-2 collab-logo"/><img src="assets/KCLlogo.gif" class="img-responsive col-sm-1 collab-logo"/><img src="assets/sas-logo.png" class="img-responsive col-sm-1 collab-logo"/><img src="assets/chf-logo.png" class="img-responsive col-sm-1 collab-logo"/></div><div class="row footer"><h3>Funding acknowledgement</h3><p>This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Services and Delivery Research Programme
